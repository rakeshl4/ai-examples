# AI Examples Repository

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the AI Examples Repository. Here you'll find some solutions and code snippets that we've talked about over on the [BinaryTrails blog](https://binarytrails.com/).

What's inside?

- C# Notebooks

## Getting Set Up

Hereâ€™s how to get started:

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended for the best experience)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (for running notebooks)

### For Python Notebooks

1. Install Python 3.7 or newer from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open a terminal and run:

   ```sh
   pip install notebook jupyterlab
   ```

3. In VS Code, install these extensions:
   - Python
   - Jupyter

### For .NET C# Notebooks

1. Install the [.NET 8.0 SDK or higher](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. Open a terminal and run:

   ```sh
   dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.dotnet-interactive
   dotnet interactive jupyter install
   ```

3. In VS Code, install the .NET Interactive Notebooks extension.

Once youâ€™ve got everything set up, just open a notebook and start experimentingâ€”either in Jupyter or right inside VS Code.

Happy coding! If you have any questions or want to chat, feel free to reach out. And donâ€™t forget to swing by the [BinaryTrails blog](https://binarytrails.com/) for more tips and articles.
